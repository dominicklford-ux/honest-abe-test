# Honest Abe Site

This project uses Bootstrap CSS, Bootstrap Icons, and Bootstrap JS to handle styling, icons, and some interactive behavior.

Interactive elements were made tabbable to support keyboard navigation and accessibility.

Forms use dummy validation and display either a success message or an error message if the phone number, ZIP code, or required fields are invalid or missing.

A location search feature was added that queries through the provided location data.

Location information is parsed and displayed correctly inside the location cards.

Rounded borders were added for styling, and border and footer colors were matched to the original test site.

The placeholder image used on the site was compressed to improve page load performance.

The site was tested on multiple screen sizes, primarily mobile and desktop, using browser inspect tools.

I considered using a different Honest Abe Roofing logo in the footer, but avoided it due to possible copyright concerns.
